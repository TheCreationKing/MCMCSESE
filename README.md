# MCMCSESE
The Minecraft MC Skin editor Skin Editor! A personal attempt at a minecraft skin editor.

It began when I made a minecraft skin for the first time in 2 years using [Popular Website], when I realized it had bugs. A lot of bugs. But not only that, I vividly remember them being there the last time too.
So I was a bit frustrated, because it's been years. And naturally I complained to my pals my buddies my chums.
I told them, "I could make a better version", so I started on it.

Well, 4 days later (today as of writing) I've made the initial version. It's only missing 1 feature of the original (well 2 if you include a tool that is called fill that isn't actually fill), which is Hexadecimal entering for color.

It's got true symmetry, and transformative symmetry.
A new 'silhouette mode' I call it, where painting only affects pixels that already exist, letting you paint underneath the top layers without needing to toggle the over layer.
It's got non continuous fill.
It has Undo/Redo (Up to 100 undo history)
Automatic detection of thin/wide arms (and exports automatically clean up the pixels too for later auto import)
A color picker tool.
